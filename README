******* QSearchAndReplace - qsar *******

QSar is a utf-8, line-oriented, threaded search and replace utility.
It can be used as a text filter in a pipe (stdin/stdout) or as a standalone utility using commandline input/output file options.
It can also use a pipe to get filenames to manipulate directly.
It uses any number of user defined dictionaries with delimeter seperated keys and values.
The keys default to simple text replacement, but can also be given as regular expressions if marked as such.
White space before and after the keys/values does not matter unless you are doing a regular expression; keys/values will be trimmed front and back before search/replacement.
The first line of every file should contain the delimeter used in that particular dictionary to separate keys and values.
