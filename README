******* QSearchAndReplace - qsar *******

Qsar can be used as a text filter in a pipe (stdin/stdout) or as a standalone utility.
It uses any number of user defined dictionaries with delimeter seperated keys and values.
The keys keys default to simple text replacement, but can also be given as regular expressions if marked as such.
White space before an after the keys/values does not matter unless you are doing a regular expression; it will be trimmed off before search/replacement.
The first line of every file should contain the delimeter used in that dictionary to separate keys and values.
